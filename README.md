# NodeJS-Learning-Progress-Repo
This is a repository to detail my NodeJS learning journey. Will try to update as much as I can.

25-09-2021: </br>
1)The start of my NodeJS journey. </br>
2)Started with the simple 'How to set up a server' stuff and learnt how the callback functions work in Node. </br>
3)Also learnt about the inner functionings of NodeJS (will look into this again since it was not that clear. Will come back to this later) </br>
4)Learnt how the requests and responses are handled, which is the most basic stuff. Found it different from Spring (the only backend framework I know at this moment). </br>
