# NodeJS-Learning-Progress-Repo
This is a repository to detail my NodeJS learning journey. Will try to update as much as I can.

### 25-09-2021     


1. The start of my NodeJS journey.    
2. Started with the simple 'How to set up a server' stuff and learnt how the callback functions work in Node.    
3. Also learnt about the inner functionings of NodeJS (will look into this again since it was not that clear. Will come back to this later).    
4. Learnt how the requests and responses are handled, which is the most basic stuff. Found it different from Spring (the only backend framework I know at this moment).     

### 26-09-2021:    

1. Started Express.js.    
2. Learnt how different routes are created using express.    
3. Learnt how to serve files statically.   
4. Introduction to the template engines.  
5. Started off with pug template engine. Will continue to go through this more next weekend(02-10-2021 & 03-10-2021)  

### 02-10-2021:

1. Started with MVC.  
2. Started building upon the shopping app.  
3. Will get into using a database (SQL and No-SQL) by tomorrow.  

### 03-10-2021:

1. Started looking into incorporating SQL into the shopping app.  
2. Learnt about the Sequelize package.
3. Will go through Sequelize more during the next weekend(09-10-2021 & 10-10-2021)  

### At this point, I'm really starting to enjoy node.js a lot. Will definitely build a project using node.js as the backend and either React or Vue as the frontend (Most likely React but do want to give Vue a try).

### 09-10-2021:

1. Finished off Sequelize. I do not like working with it.
2. Looked into TypeORM. Looks very familiar since I've already worked using Hibernate.
3. Will get into No-SQL tomorrow. MongoDB should be interesting, I hope.


### 14-10-2021:

1. Started MongoDB. Personally, it looks easier than SQL.
2. Will look more into MongoDB and Mongoose on the 15th

### 16-10-2021:

1. Finished off MongoDB. Looks simpler than SQL.
2. Starting Mongoose (ORM for NoSQL) today/tomorrow.

### 17-10-2021:

1. Finished off Mongoose. Felt much easier than native MongoDB.
2. Sessions and Cookies are next. Will look into them next week.

### 29-01-2022:

1. I lied last time. Took me 3 more months to get back into this. But happy that I picked this up again.
2. Sessions and Cookies are done.
